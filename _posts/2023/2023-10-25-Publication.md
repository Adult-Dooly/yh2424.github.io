## Abstract
We present a detailed analysis of the light extraction efficiency (LEE) of the core-shell nanorod LED using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. We found that the LEE has a deep dependence on source positions and polarization directions based on the calculated LEE results for every x and z position inside the core-shell nanorod structure. For the upper part (Pyramid) and the lower part (Sidewall) of the core-shell nanorod, the LEEs are different for Pyramid and Sidewall owing to total internal reflection (TIR) and the generated optical modes in the structure. As a result, the LEE of Sidewall is much larger than that of Pyramid. The averaged LEE of core-shell nanorod LED is also investigated with variable p-GaN thickness, n-GaN thickness, and height for the design guideline for the optimized LEE of core-shell nanorod LEDs.
