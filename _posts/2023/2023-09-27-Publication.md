## Abstract
We demonstrate the programmable light intensity of a micro-LED by compensating threshold voltage variability of thin-film transistors (TFTs) by introducing a non-volatile programmable ferroelectric material, HfZrO2 (HZO) into the gate stack of the TFT. We fabricated an amorphous ITZO TFT, ferroelectric TFTs (FeTFTs), and micro-LEDs and verified the feasibility of our proposed current-driving active matrix circuit. Importantly, we successfully present the programmed multi-level lighting of the micro-LED, utilizing partial polarization switching in the a-ITZO FeTFT. We expect that this approach will be highly promising for the next-generation display technology, replacing complicated threshold voltage compensation circuits with a simple a-ITZO FeTFT.
