To foster unity within the ASDL community in the first half of 2024, graduates and undergraduate students came together for a foot volleyball match and a barbecue with Prof. Younghyun Kim.

We aim to utilize this event to strengthen our bonds and to continue our dedication to research.

Let’s continue to strive for excellence in ASDL!

We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the professor for organizing this wonderful event.
