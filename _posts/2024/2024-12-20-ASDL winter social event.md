## Highlight
- To foster unity among ASDL members, we organized a bowling event that brought together alumni, master’s students, and undergraduates.
- The event was aimed at strengthening our bonds and reinforcing our shared commitment to research.
- I sincerely appreciate the professor who took the initiative to organize such a meaningful gathering.
