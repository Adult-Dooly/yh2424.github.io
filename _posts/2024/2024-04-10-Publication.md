## Highlight

- First application of HMDS as a passivation layer for ITZO-based oxide thin-film transistor fabrication.
- The experimental results clearly illustrate that HMDS passivation significantly improves the electrical performance and stability of the ITZO TFTs.
- Notably, our spin-coated HMDS passivation layer stands out as a cost-effective alternative among the various organic-solution-based passivation layers.

## Abstract
In this work, the fabrication and characterization of high-performance indium-tin-zinc-oxide (ITZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs) with hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) passivation are presented. The incorporation of HMDS passivation significantly enhances the electrical performance and bias stress stability of ITZO TFTs compared with those without HMDS passivation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements reveal that ITZO TFTs with HMDS passivation offer distinct advantages over those without HMDS passivation, including an increased concentration of metal oxide and a reduced concentration of oxygen vacancies and hydroxyl groups in the active channel layer. As a result, the ITZO TFTs with HMDS passivation exhibit a saturation mobility of 26.15 ± 1.14 cm<sup>2</sup>
·V<sup>–1</sup>·s<sup>–1</sup>, a subthreshold swing of 0.26 ± 0.04 V·dec<sup>–1</sup>, an on/off current ratio of 9 × 108, and excellent operational bias stress stability when compared to ITZO TFTs without HMDS passivation
