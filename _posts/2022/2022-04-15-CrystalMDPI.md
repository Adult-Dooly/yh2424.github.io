Dear Colleagues,

With the revolution in information and communications technology, the field of semiconductor optoelectronics has rapidly grown, supporting high-speed communication and energy-efficient display and lighting.  We are currently facing the next revolution, the 4th Industrial Revolution, requiring technologies such as Internet-of-things, big data, AR/VR, artificial intelligence, etc. To satisfy the increasing demands on technological developments for solutions, research on semiconductor optoelectronic materials and devices will play an important role, as it has contributed, for example, light-emitting diodes, laser diodes, photodetectors, optical modulators, and many other photonic integrated devices.

In this Special Issue, we kindly invite you to contribute your new and original research on “Semiconductor optoelectronic materials and devices” for sensing, communication, display, lighting, and computing.
